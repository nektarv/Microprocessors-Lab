# Microprocessors Lab

This repository contains the exercises developed for the **Microprocessors Lab** course at the **School of Electrical and Computer Engineering** at NTUA.

The exercises are implemented in **AVR Assembly** and **C**, targeting the **ATmega328PB** microcontroller.

I've only included the exercises that I implemented myself. The rest were implemented by my lab parnter.
