# Microprocessors Lab

This repository contains the exercises developed for the **Microprocessors Lab** course at the **School of Electrical and Computer Engineering** at NTUA.

All exercises are implemented in **AVR Assembly** and **C**, targeting the **ATmega328PB** microcontroller.

If any exercises appear to be missing, that is because they were implemented solely by my partner in this course. All exercises presented in this repo were strictly implemented by me.
